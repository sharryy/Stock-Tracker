# Stock-Tracker

This project is based upon Laravel TDD. It uses different test cases to ensure and track a stock from different retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, BestBuy etc and update their availability and status in Database. Notifications are also tested using test cases only. No Real Implementation of Notifications.

Currently , only Best Buy API is tested against Real Response.
