# Stock-Tracker

This project is based upon Laravel TDD. It uses different test cases to ensure and track a stock from different retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, BestBuy etc and update their availability and status in Database. Notifications are also tested.

Currently , only Best Buy API is tested against Real Response.
